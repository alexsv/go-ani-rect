# Go Ani Rect

This is a GUI project, which animates objects (rectangles) in changing
environment. Also it should display overlap areas dynamically.

Project interations:
- GUI try (graphic ui is quite hard, Qt as an alternative, but console is good
  by now, I will use github.com/jroimartin/gocui)
- Basic animation
- JSON configuration
- Overlapping algorythms
